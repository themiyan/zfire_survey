FROM DR8

The files in this directory contain the fluxes corresponding to
restframe filters. These are in the files udsz.*.rf files, where * is
13, 15, and 21 for the U, V, and J filters, respectively. The fluxes
are given in the 6th column of these files.

This directory also includes the zphot catalog for the photometric
catalog uds8_v0.2.test.cat; you might want to make sure that this
matches the zphots that you've been using (but this is just my
standard zphots, and doesn't included the MOSFIRE zspecs).

To get the colors, you would do something like this (IDL code):

readcol,'../EAZY_v02/OUTPUT/udsz.13.rf',tid,tz,X,X,X,LU
MU = -2.5*alog10(LU)+25.
readcol,'../EAZY_v02/OUTPUT/udsz.15.rf',tid,tz,X,X,X,LV
MV = -2.5*alog10(LV)+25.
readcol,'../EAZY_v02/OUTPUT/udsz.21.rf',tid,tz,X,X,X,LJ
MJ = -2.5*alog10(LJ)+25.
UV = MU-MV
VJ = MV-MJ
